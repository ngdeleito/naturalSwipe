Natural Swipe was a Firefox extension that made swipe gestures with three fingers consistent with natural scrolling.

This extension cannot be migrated to WebExtensions and, therefore, does not work with Firefox 57+. You can continue enjoying a swiping behavior consistent with natural scrolling by manually swapping the values of the "browser.gesture.swipe.up" and the "browser.gesture.swipe.down" preferences in about:config.

After installing this extension, swiping up with three fingers will take you to the bottom of a page; swiping down will take you to the top.

On MacOS X, make sure that the settings in "System Preferences" > "Trackpad" > "More Gestures" do not inhibit swipe gestures with three fingers in Firefox. For example:

- set "Swipe between pages" to something else than "scroll left or right with two fingers"
- and set "Mission Control" and "App Expos√©" to four fingers
